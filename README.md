=====================README========================

This repo contains a code that have a separate launch window
and may roll 3 dices by clicking on them.

Available dices:

Code may be improved in way adding new dices,
adding a menu
adding a possibility to choose how many dices you want to roll
adding a possibility to roll more dices the same type at the same time (i.e.: 2 dices d6 together)
etc...
